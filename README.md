# Unit converter
I built this project because I needed a converter for cooking and convert from cups to dl. 

### Features: 

* HTML
* Css
* JavaScript

#### Converts to and from:
* cups to dl 
and
* kg to lbs
  
(More related untis presented in a table when a value is converted)

* Works great on smaller and on larger screens, good for downloading shortcut and use on mobiles
* Dark and light theme depending on users prefered color scheme

##### I will add more units, such as currency converter for example,  in the future :)
